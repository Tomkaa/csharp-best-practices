# .editorconfig

.editorconfig will require some self-assembly. Good starting point is .editorconfig from (.NET coding convention settings for EditorConfig)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-code-style-settings-reference]. 

However it is to be noted that by default Visual Studio doesn't support all of possible `.editorconfig` options. Some are only supported by `ReSharper` for example.
